## Important concepts:

* assembler - An assembler is a type of computer program that interprets software programs written in assembly language into machine language, code and instructions that can be executed by a computer.

* BIOS - stands for Basic Input Output System, is software stored on a small memory chip on the motherboard. It's BIOS that's responsible for the POST and therefore makes it the very first software to run when a computer is started. The BIOS firmware is non-volatile, meaning that its settings are saved and recoverable even after power has been removed from the device. When BIOS boots up (starts up) your computer, it first determines whether all of the attachments are in place and operational. Then, it loads the operating system (or key parts of it) into your computer's random access memory (RAM) from your hard disk or diskette drive.
